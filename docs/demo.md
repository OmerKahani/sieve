## Using Sonar to detect a time-travel bug in rabbitmq-operator

### What is Sonar?

Sonar is a bug detection tool for finding bugs in kubernetes controllers.
Specifically, Sonar is good at finding time-travel bugs, i.e., the bugs caused by controller experiencing time traveling.

### What is a time-travel bug?

Time-travel bugs happen when the controller reads stale cluster status from a stale apiserver and behaves unexpectedly. Consider the following scenario:

<img src="time-travel.png" width="80%">

1. In a HA kubernetes cluster, the controller is connecting to apiserver1. Initially each apiserver is updated with the current cluster status `S1`, and the controller performs reconciliation according to `S1` read from apiserver1.

2. Now apiserver1's locally cached status gets updated by etcd to `S2`, while apiserver2 does not get updated yet and still holds the stale status `S1` (due to various reasons like network disruption or temporary resouce contention). The controller is not affected by the staleness of apiserver2, and performs reconciliation according to `S2` from apiserver1.

3. The controller restarts after experiencing a node failure and connects to apiserver2. The controller reads stale `S1` and perform reconciliation accordingly. The reconciliation triggered by reading `S1` may lead to some unexpected behavior and cause failures like data loss or service unavailability.

We will use [a time-travel bug](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/issues/648) in [rabbitmq-operator](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator) found by Sonar to show the end-to-end experience of testing the controller using Sonar.

### Prerequisite
**Kind cluster is required**. Sonar tests the controller in a kind cluster.

**The controller needs to be recompiled**. Sonar needs to instrument the `controller_runtime` and `client_go` libraries and rebuild the controller image. The instrumentation is automatically done.

**Test workloads are required.** Sonar doesn't generate test workloads to run. Sonar can reuse any existing e2e test workload that doesn't perform cluster set up (Sonar will set up the cluster for testing). We also wrote some simple workloads for Sonar.

### Testing the controller with time travel config
Now, let's test the rabbitmq-operator
```
python3 run.py -p rabbitmq-operator -t test1 -c log/rabbitmq-operator/test1/learn/generated-config/time-travel-1.yaml
```
`test1` is the test workload (written by us) Sonar will run.
The workload simply does three things:
1. it creates a rabbitmq cluster `kubectl apply -f rmqc-1.yaml`
2. it deletes the rabbitmq cluster `kubectl delete RabbitmqCluster rabbitmq-cluster`
3. it recreates the rabbitmq cluster `kubectl apply -f rmqc-1.yaml`

`log/rabbitmq-operator/test1/learn/generated-config/time-travel-1.yaml` is the time-travel config which guides the failure testing (we will explain how the config works later).

By typing the command, Sonar will:
1. run `test1` in the kind cluster;
2. create the time-travel scenario during testing according to `time-travel-1.yaml`.

When it finishes, you will see the bug report generated by Sonar:
```
[CHECKING] side effect
[ERROR] statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server Create inconsistency: normal: 2, testing: 3
[ERROR] statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server Delete inconsistency: normal: 1, testing: 2
[BUG REPORT] # alarms: 2
[TIME TRAVEL DESC] Sonar makes the controller time travel back to the history to see the status just after rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster: {"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SONAR-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}} (at kind-control-plane3)
[DEBUG SUGGESTION] Please check how controller reacts when seeing rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster: {"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SONAR-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}}, the controller may issue deletion to statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server without proper checking
```
Sonar generates a bug report saying the controller issues more creation and deletion of `statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server` than normal, and suggest that this inconsistency is probably caused by controller issuing deletion without proper checking when seeing the non-nil `deletionTimestamp` of `rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster`.

### Debugging with Sonar report
Sonar gives us a hint about the bug, but cannot automatically tell the root cause. Debugging still requires some manual efforts. Here is my experience:

I searched `deletionTimestamp` in the controller code to see how the controller reacts to it and I found:
```go
	// Check if the resource has been marked for deletion
	if !rabbitmqCluster.ObjectMeta.DeletionTimestamp.IsZero() {
		logger.Info("Deleting")
		return ctrl.Result{}, r.prepareForDeletion(ctx, rabbitmqCluster)
	}
```
The controller immediatelly deletes the statefulset when seeing non-nil `deletionTimestamp` without checking the ownership of the statefulset in `prepareForDeletion`.

Combining the `TIME TRAVEL DESC` and the `DEBUG SUGGESTION` from Sonar, the bug is identified:
After the rabbitmq cluster gets recreated by `test1`, Sonar makes the controller time travel back to see the non-nil `deletionTimestamp` (caused by the previous rabbitmq cluster deletion). Since the controller does not check statefuset ownership in `prepareForDeletion`, it immediately deletes the currently running statefulset as a reaction of seeing the stale `deletionTimestamp`.

The detected bug is filed at https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/issues/648 and has been fixed.

### How does Sonar find bugs?
To detect time-travel bugs, Sonar runs in two phases to force the controller experience time travel by injecting apiserver pause and controller restart.

The first phase is called *learing phase* where Sonar runs the test workload (without any injection) and records the events triggering controller reconciliation and side effects (resource creation/deletion/update) invoked by the controller. Sonar analyzes the controller trace and finds out the causality between events and side effects, and generate the time-travel config (i.e., `log/rabbitmq-operator/test1/learn/generated-config/time-travel-1.yaml`) to guide the following testing phase. Sonar also records the cluster status and controller behavior as part of the testing oracle.

The second phase is called *testing phase* where Sonar runs the test workload and injects apiserver pause and controller restart at certain timing according to the time-travel config. Sonar compares the cluster status and controller behavior in the testing run and the learning run, and generates a bug report if any inconsistency is detected.


### What is in the time-travel config?

The time-travel config specified when running the test is used to guide Sonar to create the time-travel scenario. Recall that we need to pause the apiserver and restart the controller at *certain timing*, and the time-travel config specifies the important timing for pause/restart.

Let's look into the generated time-travel config `log/rabbitmq-operator/test1/learn/generated-config/time-travel-1.yaml`:
```
project: rabbitmq-operator
mode: time-travel
straggler: kind-control-plane3
front-runner: kind-control-plane
operator-pod-label: rabbitmq-operator
deployment-name: rabbitmq-operator
timing: after
ce-name: rabbitmq-cluster
ce-namespace: default
ce-rtype: rabbitmqcluster
ce-diff-current: '{"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SONAR-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}}'
ce-diff-previous: '{}'
ce-etype-current: Updated
ce-etype-previous: Updated
se-name: rabbitmq-cluster-server
se-namespace: default
se-rtype: statefulset
se-etype: ADDED
description: 'Pause kind-control-plane3 after it processes a default/rabbitmqcluster/rabbitmq-cluster
  event E. E should match the pattern {"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SONAR-NON-NIL",
  "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}} and the events before E should match {}. And restart
  the controller rabbitmq-operator after kind-control-plane processes a ADDED default/statefulset/rabbitmq-cluster-server
  event.'
```
It looks quite complicated. But don't worry. For now, you only need to understand a few fields here.

First,
```
straggler: kind-control-plane3
front-runner: kind-control-plane
```
means during testing we want to pause apiserver3 (which runs on `kind-control-plane3`) at *certain timing* to create the stale status.
And we use apiserver1 (which runs on `kind-control-plane`) as a referrence to restart the controller at *certain timing*.
The difficult part is how to decide the *timing* here.

Now let's look at
```
ce-name: rabbitmq-cluster
ce-namespace: default
ce-rtype: rabbitmqcluster
ce-diff-current: '{"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SONAR-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}}'
ce-diff-previous: '{}'
```
This is how Sonar decides when to pause the apiserver3. When Sonar sees an event belonging to `rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster` and contains the sub-map in `ce-diff-current`, and a previous event contains the sub-map in `ce-diff-previous`,
Sonar will pause the apiserver3. Here, `ce-diff-current` basically means the event sets a `deletionTimestamp`, and `ce-diff-previous` does not pose any constraint since it is empty.

Finally, Sonar needs to decide when to restart the controller
```
se-name: rabbitmq-cluster-server
se-namespace: default
se-rtype: statefulset
se-etype: ADDED
```
When Sonar sees an `ADDED` event belonging to `statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server`, it will restart the controller and connect the controller to the paused apiserver3.

You will also find the explanation from the `description` field.


### How is the time-travel config generated?
The biggest challenge to generate the above time-travel config is to find out the appropriate timing for injecting pause/restart.

As mentioned above, Sonar has a learning phase to infer the causality between events triggering `reconcile()` and side effects (resource creation/update/deletion) issued during `reconcile()`,
and Sonar then picks each potentially causal-related <event, side effect> pair to decide the timing. 

To do so, run:
```
python3 run.py -p rabbitmq-operator -t test1 -m learn
```
The command will run test workload `test1`, collect the events and side effects, infer the causality and generate the time-travel config.

After it finishes, you will see
```
Generated 1 time-travel config(s) in log/rabbitmq-operator/test1/learn/generated-config
```

The generated config is exactly the one shown before.
