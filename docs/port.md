## Port a new operator:
In general, you will need to fill the entries in https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve/blob/main/controllers.py and prepare some Dockerfile, build scripts, deploy scripts and test scripts.

### Build
The first thing is to be able to build the operator image.

What you need to do is to slightly modify the Dockerfile to also copy the sieve library into the build image. See [zookeeper-operator](https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve/blob/4ccc3da5e6d528d52b375be067160bbc052d49b5/test-zookeeper-operator/build/Dockerfile#L17)

Besides, you need to prepare a `build.sh` that builds an image and pushes it to your docker repo.
As an example, here is the modified Dockerfile and `build.sh` for the [zookeeper-operator](https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve/tree/main/test-zookeeper-operator/build).
Your Dockerfile will replace the original one, and the `build.sh` will be run in the operator directory to build the image. These are done by `build.py`, and you only need to specify related entries in `controllers.py`. Instrumentation will also be automatically done by `build.py` according to the mode you specify.

### Deploy
The second step is to be able to deploy (or install) the (instrumented) operator in your kind cluster.

Concretely, deploying the operator often requires to install the CRDs and related RBAC config. For example, `kubectl create -f deploy/crds` and `kubectl create -f deploy/default_ns/rbac.yaml` for the [zookeeper-operator](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator#manual-deployment).

For a new controller, you need to modify the deployment config of the operator to do the following:
1. Add a label: `sonartag: YOUR_OPERATOR_NAME`. So sieve can later find the pod. See [zookeeper-operator](https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve/blob/b4abe83426d5e2f4564563effe6ea380ae2831b8/test-zookeeper-operator/deploy/default_ns/operator.yaml#L10).
2. Replace the operator image repo name with `${SONAR-DR}`, and replace the tag with `${SONAR-DT}`. So sieve can use the right image when running the tests. See [zookeeper-operator](https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve/blob/b4abe83426d5e2f4564563effe6ea380ae2831b8/test-zookeeper-operator/deploy/default_ns/operator.yaml#L21).
3. Specify env variables `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` and `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT` and import configmap `sonar-testing-global-config` in the yaml file. See [zookeeper-operator](https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve-issue-only/blob/481de8a61b8362f96dbf0e46c8dfe150ae786fbd/test-zookeeper-operator/deploy/default_ns/operator.yaml#L39).
4. Set `imagePullPolicy` for the operator container to be `IfNotPresent` (for CI run). See [zookeeper-operator](https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve-issue-only/blob/481de8a61b8362f96dbf0e46c8dfe150ae786fbd/test-zookeeper-operator/deploy/default_ns/operator.yaml#L27)

See https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve/blob/main/test-zookeeper-operator/deploy/default_ns/operator.yaml as a complete example.
After figuring out how to deploy the operator, write them down in `controllers.py` as the [zookeeper-operator](https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve/blob/32c003016cb95e05487b9609115efa6325a36606/controllers.py#L155).

### Test
The final step is to prepare the test workloads, and sieve learning mode will automatically generate the time-travel config for the workload. The workload is often simple -- create/delete/create some resources, scale down/up some resources, or disable/enable some features in the spec. We provide a framework to write test workload. See examples in https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve/blob/main/workloads.py.

Besides, you can also specify a command line to run the test workload in https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve/blob/main/controllers.py.

After writing the workload, register it in `controllers.py` like the [zookeeper-operator](https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve/blob/4ccc3da5e6d528d52b375be067160bbc052d49b5/controllers.py#L71).
After that, build the learning mode images
```
python3 build.py -p kubernetes -m learn -d YOUR_DOCKER_REPO_NAME
python3 build.py -p YOUR_OPERATOR_NAME -m learn -d YOUR_DOCKER_REPO_NAME
```
Run the learning mode
```
python3 sieve.py -p YOUR_OPERATOR_NAME -m learn -t YOUR_TEST_NAME
```
You will get some config files generated by sieve in `log/YOUR_OPERATOR_NAME/YOUR_TEST_NAME/learn/generated-config`.
To test them all, run
```
python3 sieve.py -p YOUR_OPERATOR_NAME -t YOUR_TEST_NAME -b
```
to test one of them (which you think is more promising)
```
python3 sieve.py -p YOUR_OPERATOR_NAME -t YOUR_TEST_NAME -c YOUR_FAVOURITE_CONFIG
```
Usually, if you can see `[ERROR]` in stdout, it indicates a bug.
